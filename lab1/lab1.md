## Experience Programming in Python:

What did you like/not like about Python?

Like: Python’s syntax is really clean and easy to read, which makes coding faster and more understanding. The language is full of libraries that support various functionalities.

Dislike: Python's dynamic typing can sometimes lead to runtime errors that would be caught at compile-time in statically typed languages like C/C++.

Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?

Yes, Python's loops and list comprehensions work differently from C/C++, which took some getting used to. Also, managing mutable and immutable types in Python can be tricky and sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

## Similarities and Differences between Python and C/C++:

Similarities: Both Python and C/C++ support procedural and object-oriented programming. They have similar basic control structures like loops and conditionals.

Differences: Python is an interpreted language, while C/C++ is compiled, which usually makes C/C++ faster. Python’s dynamic typing is more flexible but can lead to runtime errors, whereas C/C++’s static typing helps catch errors at compile time. Python automatically manages memory with garbage collection, while C/C++ requires manual memory management (allocation and deallocation).
